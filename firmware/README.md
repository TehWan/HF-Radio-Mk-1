# Firmware for STM32F429I-DISC1 dev-board
We have chosen to make make most of the DSP (Digital Signal Processing) in software like modern SDR's (Software Defined Radio).
For this project, we have selected the STM32F429I-DISC1 as the main control board for our project for many reasons:
- STM32 Ecosystem for Embedded development
- Embedded ADC 12bit 2.4MSps
- Embedded DAC 12 bit 1MSps
- USB FS interface
- Low cost dev-board available
- LCD display (bonus)
- Open Source Hardware project available
